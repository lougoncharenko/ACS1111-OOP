# Objects and Encapsilation

A CLASS is a blueprint to make objects (aka instances)
Classes define the data (called attributes) and behaviors (called methods) that characterize objects.
An attribute is a variable connected and unique to its class.
A method is a function inside a class that can act on an objectâ€™s data.


self in python is like "this" in javascript
__init__ is like the constructor() in javascript
